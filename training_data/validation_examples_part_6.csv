"I’m planning to create a digital archive for oral histories from immigrant communities in my city.

I need a complete preservation workflow: digitization standards, metadata schema (with multilingual support), ethical consent model for participants, and cloud storage recommendations that balance cost and durability. Accessibility is critical, so transcripts and translations must be available, with clear attribution and permissions for reuse by educators and researchers.","I’m planning to create a digital archive for oral histories from immigrant communities in my city.
