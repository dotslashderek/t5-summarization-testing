"We’re inheriting a Go service that talks to Postgres and Kafka but lacks context timeouts, retries, or structured logs; deployments occasionally wedge on ECS. I need a pragmatic modernization plan that will replace blocking IO with suspending calls, normalize error models, and introduce feature flags for safe canary rollouts. Constraints: cost controls matter: watch egress and storage growth; keep choices vendor-agnostic, and we can only spare ~20% of engineering time for four sprints. Please keep the rollout incremental with canaries, and include clear rollback steps if error budgets are breached. Also, Deliverables: a minimal Makefile or CI snippet to run tests, formatters, and security scans, a four-phase plan with acceptance criteria per phase and a risk/mitigation table. If there are trade‑offs, call them out explicitly and recommend a safe default. When timing or reservations matter, provide exact windows or deadlines.
