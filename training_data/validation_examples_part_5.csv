"I’m planning to overhaul our internal developer onboarding process, which currently relies on a series of outdated Confluence pages and word-of-mouth tribal knowledge. The goal is to create a consistent, engaging 30-day onboarding journey that covers everything from setting up local environments to understanding our microservice architecture and deployment pipelines. We’re a distributed company with engineers across six time zones, so asynchronous learning and self-paced modules are key. I’d like a proposal outlining the phases (orientation, tooling, first PR, first feature), templates for documentation, a mentorship pairing model, and metrics for success (time-to-first-commit, survey satisfaction). Also include strategies for keeping this onboarding content evergreen through quarterly updates and contribution incentives.","I’m planning to overhaul our internal developer onboarding process, which currently relies on a series of outdated Confluence pages and word-of-mouth tribal knowledge.

"I’m designing an interactive online exhibit for a natural history museum that explores the hidden connections between urban wildlife and city infrastructure. The site should blend storytelling, scientific accuracy, and user participation. I need a content architecture plan that includes core narrative threads (e.g., pigeons and architecture, raccoons and garbage systems), a media strategy (audio clips, maps, citizen-submitted photos), and a lightweight backend for tagging and moderation. Accessibility and data ethics are musts—no tracking cookies or hidden analytics. Please also outline how to measure engagement beyond simple click metrics, perhaps through dwell time, contributions, or repeat visits.","I’m designing an interactive online exhibit for a natural history museum that explores the hidden connections between urban wildlife and city infrastructure.

"Our nonprofit wants to launch a mentorship program connecting underrepresented students in STEM with working professionals across industries. I need a detailed implementation plan: recruitment funnel for mentors and mentees, matching algorithm criteria (interests, goals, region), and a lightweight portal design that can scale without enterprise software costs. Privacy compliance (especially for minors) is critical. Please also suggest success metrics (retention, satisfaction, outcomes) and long-term sustainability ideas, such as corporate sponsorships or university partnerships. Assume we have two part-time staff and limited technical support, so efficiency is key.","Our nonprofit wants to launch a mentorship program connecting underrepresented students in STEM with working professionals across industries.

"I’m drafting a 12-month roadmap to make our SaaS product fully compliant with major accessibility standards (WCAG 2.2 AA). This includes audits, developer training, and integrating accessibility into our CI/CD pipeline. I’d like a phased plan that prioritizes high-impact areas first—navigation, color contrast, keyboard support, ARIA roles—then moves toward deeper refactors. Include ways to test with real users (screen readers, low vision, mobility challenges) and outline metrics for tracking progress over time. Finally, add recommendations for maintaining compliance as new features ship, and how to communicate improvements transparently to customers.","I’m drafting a 12-month roadmap to make our SaaS product fully compliant with major accessibility standards (WCAG 2.2 AA).

"We’re producing a podcast series about the future of food systems, focusing on climate resilience, cultural traditions, and emerging technologies. I need a production plan for 8 episodes covering topics like vertical farming, indigenous seed sovereignty, and lab-grown meat ethics. Please include research workflow, guest sourcing strategy, narrative structure (cold open, interview, reflection), and a sustainable publishing cadence. Also describe how to balance expert voices with lived experience and how to repurpose content (transcripts, blogs, social snippets) for accessibility and growth.","We’re producing a podcast series about the future of food systems, focusing on climate resilience, cultural traditions, and emerging technologies.

"I’m creating a speculative design proposal for a city built around circular economy principles—no waste, closed energy loops, and shared community infrastructure. I need help defining key systems: energy, transportation, housing, and digital governance. Each should include examples of real-world pilots or technologies that could make them feasible. The tone should be visionary but grounded in plausible technology. Please also include a visual storytelling framework: how would we communicate this city through maps, artifacts, and citizen narratives? End with a short section on ethical tradeoffs or unintended consequences.","I’m creating a speculative design proposal for a city built around circular economy principles—no waste, closed energy loops, and shared community infrastructure.

"Our HR team wants to design a four-week professional development program focused on cross-cultural collaboration. We have employees in 10 countries and frequent communication breakdowns. I’d like a syllabus that mixes async learning (videos, readings) and live sessions (role-play, reflection circles). Topics should include communication norms, bias awareness, and conflict resolution styles. Please add metrics for assessing effectiveness (feedback surveys, retention of diverse hires) and suggest a lightweight LMS setup using existing tools like Google Workspace or Notion. Include a strategy for keeping content updated annually.","Our HR team wants to design a four-week professional development program focused on cross-cultural collaboration.

"I’m preparing a detailed proposal for a startup accelerator focused on climate tech ventures in the Global South. Please outline program structure (selection criteria, mentorship model, funding mechanism), example partner organizations, and how to ensure equitable participation across regions. I’d like to emphasize capacity-building rather than quick exits. Include a sample 3-month curriculum, governance structure for the fund, and measurement framework for long-term impact. Assume limited initial capital but strong access to local university ecosystems.","I’m preparing a detailed proposal for a startup accelerator focused on climate tech ventures in the Global South.

"We’re developing a new mobile app to help urban commuters find the healthiest and most sustainable route options (e.g., walking paths, bike lanes, air-quality data). I need a product spec that defines core features, data sources, privacy considerations, and gamification ideas (badges, streaks). Include wireframe descriptions for 3 main screens and an MVP launch plan for one pilot city. Also discuss partnerships with local transport authorities and long-term monetization strategies that don’t rely on ads.","We’re developing a new mobile app to help urban commuters find the healthiest and most sustainable route options (e.g., walking paths, bike lanes, air-quality data).

"I’m researching the ethical implications of synthetic media—deepfakes, AI voice synthesis, and virtual influencers—for an upcoming conference talk. Please create a structured outline: introduction framing, key technologies, societal risks (disinformation, identity theft), and potential regulation models. Include notable case studies, suggested visuals, and a short reading list. The talk should balance technical depth and public accessibility, ideally 25 minutes long with a 5-minute Q&A at the end.","I’m researching the ethical implications of synthetic media—deepfakes, AI voice synthesis, and virtual influencers—for an upcoming conference talk.
